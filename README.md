# Freethought Friday

> What makes a free thinker is not his beliefs, but the way in which he holds them. 
> If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought, he finds a balance of evidence in their favor, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. 
> <br/> &mdash; _Bertrand Russell in "The Value of Free Thought" (1944)_

### Motivation

Series of white papers by Abraham Loeb on [creating a diverse scientific research strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1586) and [facilitating an environment for unrestricted research](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3812).

### Guidelines

> The freedom that the freethinker seeks is not the absolute freedom of anarchy; it is freedom within the intellectual law.
> &mdash; _Bertrand Russell in "The Value of Free Thought" (1944)_

Set procedural guidelines and rules governing conduct always risk to stifle creativity and innovation. 
Nevertheless, it is important to outline procedures for proposing ideas, organizing participants, etc., so to avoid chaos when each meeting is convened. 

 * Ideas are to be proposed by 12.00 (Noon) on the Friday of the gathering for inclusion in the week's meeting.
 * Ideas should be independent from larger research projects.
 * An idea's proposer gets 3 minutes at the beginning of the session to introduce their proposal.
 * Participants get 2 minutes to ask clarifying questions.
 * Break off into groups to tackle problems.

Code of conduct:
 
 * Criticism is welcome and strongly encouraged, but should always be constructive.
 * Ask questions: whether you are unsure or have doubts about something. 

Terms of participation:

 * Once an idea is proposed, the proposer relinquishes ownership to the group.
 * Ideas and a brief description of the proposal will be kept on GitHub in a public repository.

Implementation of specific guidelines can and should be debated as the meetings grow and develop.
