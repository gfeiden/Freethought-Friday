# Freethought Friday

> What makes a free thinker is not his beliefs, but the way in which he holds them. 
> If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought, he finds a balance of evidence in their favor, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. 
> <br/><br/> &mdash; _Bertrand Russell in "The Value of Free Thought" (1944)_

### What is Freethrough Friday?

Freethough Friday is a weekly gathering of scientists, driven by curiosity, who wish to explore open questions that may or may not produce tangible results in the near future. 


### Who May Attend?

Anyone with an open mind and a willingness to learn is encouraged to attend meetings, which are held on Friday afternoon at 15.15 in Ångströmlaboratoriet room TBD.

### Motivation

Scientific endeavors are often focused on producing tangible results to satisfy the watchful eye of funding agencies so to help scientists progress from one grant to the next. 
Programs deemed suitable for study must often be aimed to satisfy particular critera such as public interest or the broader research directions outlined by the organization. 
Perhaps it is natural for funding organizations to structure themselves in this manner, they are often publicly funded and justifying continued public support requires visiblity within the media, the latter of which is only interested in what sells.

However, I contend this is not the natural mindset of most scientists. 
Instead, scientists gravitate toward questions that pique their curiosity or that they find deeply unsettling. 
One might consider this an idealistic or romantic view of a scientist and one that is not tennable if one wishes to pursue a research career. 
Nevertheless, one can catch glimpses of this romantic ideal while still maintaining a more "mainstream" research program by setting time aside each week to explore "risky" ideas.

This all follows a trian of thought encapsulated in a series of white papers by Abraham Loeb on [creating a diverse scientific research strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1586) and [facilitating an environment for unrestricted research](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3812), and from more philosophical conversations with several scientists regarding intellectual and academic freedom. 

### Procedure & Guidelines

> The freedom that the freethinker seeks is not the absolute freedom of anarchy; it is freedom within the intellectual law.
> &mdash; _Bertrand Russell in "The Value of Free Thought" (1944)_

Set procedural guidelines and rules governing conduct always risk to stifle creativity and innovation. 
However, structure is needed to outline procedures for proposing ideas, organizing participants, etc., so to avoid anarchy when each meeting is convened. 

On Proposing Ideas:

 * Ideas are to be proposed by 12.00 (Noon) on the Friday of the gathering for inclusion in the week's meeting.
 * Ideas should ideally be independent from larger research programs. 
 * An idea's proposer gets 3 minutes at the beginning of the session to introduce their proposal.
 * Other Participants get 2 minutes to ask _clarifying_ questions.

Code of conduct:
 
 * Criticism is welcome and strongly encouraged, but should always be constructive.
 * Ask questions: whether you are unsure or have doubts about something. 
 * Keep comments and questions concise. 

Terms of participation:

 * Once an idea is proposed, the proposer relinquishes ownership to the group.
 * Ideas and a brief description of the proposal will be kept on GitHub in a public repository.

Implementation of specific guidelines can and should be debated as the meetings grow and develop.
