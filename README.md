# Freethought Friday

> What makes a free thinker is not his beliefs, but the way in which he holds them. 
> If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought, he finds a balance of evidence in their favor, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. 
> <br/> &mdash; _Bertrand Russell in "The Value of Free Thought" (1944)_

### Motivation

Series of white papers by Abraham Loeb on [creating a diverse scientific research strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1586) and [facilitating an environment for unrestricted research](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3812).

## Guidelines

> The freedom that the freethinker seeks is not the absolute freedom of anarchy; it is freedom within the intellectual law.
> &mdash; _Bertrand Russell in "The Value of Free Thought" (1944)_
